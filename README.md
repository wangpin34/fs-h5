# fs-h5
Decorate future HTML5 file api to node style file system api. 

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/fs-h5.png?stars&downloads)](https://nodei.co/npm/fs-h5/)

## headers-up
>In April 2014, it was [announced on public-webapps](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014AprJun/0010.html) that the Filesystem API spec is not being considered by other browsers. For now, the API is Chrome-specific and it's unlikely to be implemented by other browsers and is no longer being standardized with the W3C.

Actuall it's only supported by Chrome, and also several envs which are using Chrome core like nwjs, cordova etc. It is still useful.

It's created by es6, so you need to convert it by babel with specify preset.

For simple usage, please download standalone release.

## Install

* Via npm

  ```javascript
  npm install fs-h5 --save
  ```

*  Download standalone

	1. For develop
	```
		<script type="text/javascript" src="http://rawgit.com/wangpin34/fs-h5/master/lib/fs.js"></script>
	```

	2. For production,compressed code
	```
		<script type="text/javascript" src="http://rawgit.com/wangpin34/fs-h5/master/build/fs.js"></script>
	```

## Usage

## API

* fs.init(bytes, callback)
	
    Initialize specified spaces file sandbox. This function should be called before all fs api perform.

    **Note**ï¼šthe first argument of callback always been error object or null. 

* fs.isInitialized()
	
	Return the state that indicates whether file system is initialized succssfully.

* fs.existsDir(path, callback)

  Test whether or not the given directory exists by checking with the file system. Then call the callback argument with either true or false. Example:

 	```
 	fs.exists(path, (err, exists) => {
	  console.log(exists ? 'it\'s there' : 'non-exist!');
	});

 	```
